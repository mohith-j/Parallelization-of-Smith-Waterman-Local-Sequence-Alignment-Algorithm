# Parallelization-of-Smith-Waterman-Local-Sequence-Alignment-Algorithm
In our project, we have implemented the Smith-Waterman Algorithm in a serial and parallel manner (openMP, openMP+SIMD) for local alignment of gene sequences. We have compared the results of the implementation for sequential, parallel using openMP, parallel using openMP+SIMD. Analysis have been carried out after comparisons and results have been presented. At last we would like to conclude that parallel implementation of local gene sequencing using Smith-Waterman algorithm is advantageous when compared to sequential one. With the development in biotechnology parallel implementation would actually help in processing out large data-sets used for this problem.
